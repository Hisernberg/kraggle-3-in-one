# Automated daily loop: runbook and state

Goal: every UTC day, submit up to 5 files, each one locally validated and each changing a single
factor. Submit one at a time, read the score, learn, report. Runs until the deadline, 2026-11-07
06:55 UTC.

Helpers: `trafficflow/loop.py` (`status`, `pack`, `diff`, `submit`, `rank`, `backup`). Run everything
from the repository root with `PYTHONPATH=.`.

**Scope.** The repository (`Hisernberg/kraggle-3-in-one`) holds several competitions, one folder each.
This loop works only on the traffic project:
- everything it creates or edits lives in `trafficflow/`, with docs in `trafficflow/docs/`;
- it never edits another competition's folder or the shared root files;
- data and artefacts stay outside the repository (`/home/user/data`, `/home/user/cache`, `/home/user/work`).

> **No research agents (firm, since 2026-09-27 04:50 UTC).**
> - The user stopped a research agent again right after it started.
> - Research continues only as local shell jobs (training, builds, evaluations) and as analysis in the
>   main session.

## Schedule (UTC; Routines fire into this session)
| Time | Job |
|---|---|
| 00:07 | **Daily chain:** submit the queued candidates one at a time, reading each score before the next |
| 12:43 | **Heartbeat:** review finished research, submit newly validated candidates, launch the next experiments |
| 21:13 | **Evening sweep:** spend the remaining quota (validated candidates first, then probes that answer an open question), queue tomorrow's candidates, start overnight jobs |

Background agents and jobs wake the session when they finish, so work continues between firings.

## Every firing, in order
1. `python3 -m trafficflow.loop status`. It reports quota used/left today, pending scores, the best
   file, free disk, credentials and missing critical files. If credentials or files are missing, go
   to **Recovery**.
2. Read **Current best**, **Candidate queue** and **Decision log** below.
3. Review finished agent/job results against the **Gates**. Build each passing candidate on the
   current best:
   - `make_submission ... --out /home/user/work/subs/<ID>.csv`
   - `loop pack` the CSV
   - `loop diff` against the best zip, which must touch only the intended rows.
4. Submit with `python3 -m trafficflow.loop submit <zip> -m "<ID>: <change>; <local evidence>"`.
   Add `--probe` for probes. After each score, apply the adoption rule, then rebuild the next
   candidate on the new best if the best changed.
5. After the firing's last submission, run `python3 -m trafficflow.loop rank`.
6. Update `trafficflow/docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` (LB log rows and what was learned) and this file (best,
   queue, decision log). Commit and push to `claude/focused-allen-uzq8gr`. Pushes update the open draft PR; merging is the user's call.
7. Report in the chat:
   - a table of submission, change, public score, Δ and post-rebuild rank;
   - the best so far and the gap to #1;
   - what we learned, and what comes next.

   Send one push notification a day, once the day's submissions are done.
8. Launch the next experiments: at most 2 LightGBM jobs at once, 2 threads each (4 cores, 15 GB).
   Keep at least 2.5 GB of disk free. Agents never submit or commit.
9. Once a day (evening sweep), back up the artefacts: `python3 -m trafficflow.loop backup`
   (**Backup** below).

## Current best
**`H5w_t1ramp_dark.zip` = 0.86838** (2026-09-27). #1 KTK 0.90038.

Build:
```
python3 -m trafficflow.make_submission --state-tag ens345w7 --recon-a 0.75 --gate 0.6 \
  --smooth "free=0.0075,free_a=0.001,gate=0.02,gate_a=0.005,dark=0.05" \
  --queue /home/user/work/t2/lgb_v8_seeds9_stack03.csv --odme /home/user/work/t4/t4_l2proj.csv \
  --out /home/user/work/subs/<ID>.csv --note "<ID>: ..."
python3 -m trafficflow.loop pack /home/user/work/subs/<ID>.csv
```

- **Task 1:** regular rows = mean of `full3`, `full4`, `full5`, `full7`; blackout rows = `full7`.
  - FD features; `TFB_SEED` 0 / 1 / 2 / 4. `full7` adds ramp-flow features (`TFB_RAMP=1`).
  - `state_ens345w7.parquet` comes from `t1_pipeline ensw --tag ens345w7 --new full7 --members full3 full4 full5 --w-reg 0.25 --w-dark 1.0`.
  - Density reconciliation where v < 0.6·v_f (a = 0.75), then TV smoothing.
- **Task 2:** `lgb_v8_seeds9_stack03`.
  - Onset v8: stacking + 9 seeds on hybrid labels.
  - Ongoing: the v5 blend.
- **Task 4:** L2 projection.

Exact decomposition: ODME 0.19876, Task 1+3 0.43268, queue 0.23633 (S_queue 0.7878: onset 0.732,
ongoing 0.843).

## Gates
**Candidate:** one locally validated change against the current best.
- **Adopt** as the new best if LB Δ ≥ +0.0005. A Δ between 0 and +0.0005 needs a matching local
  prediction.
- **Task 1/3 gate:** J = 0.35·S_state + 0.10·S_LWR (full-coverage holdout, realistic blackouts,
  `trafficflow/t1_lwr_eval.py`) improves on at least 3 of 4 panels, and the mean improves.
- **Task 2 gate** (since 2026-09-25; TASK2_ANALYSIS.md section 17). All three must hold:
  1. **Plain CV.**
     - The hybrid-truth score is ≥ best − 0.002.
     - The conservative evaluation (re-drawn windows, old truth) is ≥ best − 0.002 and within one paired SE of 0.
     - Onset, ongoing or the non-recurrent slices improve.
  2. **Shift-weighted CV** (`trafficflow/t2/shift_cv.py`: `weights`, `score`). The Δ is positive under both the validation and the private weighting. Reject if either is below −1 SE.
  3. **Footprint check** (`shift_cv.footprint_check`, on both months). A flag (≥ p95) means the change goes to the LB as a probe first and is never adopted directly. A flag on private means don't adopt at all.

  Applied retroactively, this gate makes the right call on all 8 past Task 2 changes. That includes G3 (+0.0065 in plain CV but −0.023 on March), which the footprint check flags.
- **Local gain, LB Δ ≤ 0:** not adopted. It goes on the robust list for the final pick, since there
  are only 40 windows per Task 2 condition and private is a different month (7 incidents vs 5).

**Probe:** measures something, such as one task's score or a calibration direction. Never adopted.

**Never:**
- more than 5 per UTC day, or anything after 23:45 UTC;
- an untested change;
- a blind resubmission after an ERROR.

## Candidate queue
**Chain for 2026-09-27** (the user asked for 5 submissions, one at a time, each analysed before the next).
Adoption rules are fixed before submitting:

1. **H3** (H2 with a third Task 1 seed, `ens345`).
   - Local J +0.00023, 4/4 panels.
   - Adopt if Δ ≥ +0.0001.
2. **G7** (best with ongoing = v7, the v5 ongoing recipe retrained on hybrid labels, `lgb_v8og7.csv`).
   - **Done: 0.86779 (−0.00020). Not adopted; ongoing label work is closed.**
3. **H5w** (Task 1 ramp-feature member full7; regular rows = mean of full3/4/5/7, blackout rows = full7 alone).
   - The equal-weight gate passed (+0.00039, 4/4). The per-kind weighting gives +0.00081 on 4/4 (EXPERIMENTS.md).
   - Adopt if Δ ≥ +0.0001 and it matches the local ΔJ (+0.0008) within 0.0002.
4. **H6** (dark-only booster member hold8/full8, `dark_member.sh`).
   - The hold7 blackout models all stopped at the 3000-round cap (under-fitted).
   - Blackout cells are about 2% of test targets but carry 20–55% of the speed SSE.
   - Settings: ramp features, 127 leaves, lr 0.1, up to 4000 rounds, 250k rows per panel.
   - J gate vs H5w's dark rows (3/4 panels + mean). Adopt if Δ ≥ +0.0001.
5. **Ongoing capacity probe (v11)**, if its CV passes: og_v3 / og_v3_noloc at `p3` (255 leaves, 900 rounds) in the v5 blend.
   - Past capacity steps (31→63→127 leaves) each gave about +0.01 CV, and the v5 capacity gain transferred to March.
   - Gate: sim ≥ +0.005 over p2 and no worse on the recurrence < 0.05 slice. LB probe; adopt if Δ ≥ +0.0005.

**Checked and closed today (no submission needed):**
- Task 2 onset with ramp-flow features (+0.15% log-loss only).
- Characteristic (kinematic-wave) features for blackout cells: corr(ch − li, y − li) = −0.07. Congested waves travel 20+ km over a 90-min blackout.
- Off-ramp share as a mainline-flow meter: ramps carry only 1–2.5% of mainline flow; the implied flow error (67–130 veh/h per lane) is worse than the model's.
- TV smoothing strength for the 4-member ensemble: ×0.5–0.75 gives +0.00004 only; it stays at 1.0.
- Scenario shift train → March/April: none (capacity q99.9, peak flow and median speed match; only per-panel queue shares move).
- March onset site check (TASK2_ANALYSIS §19): site hits 0.775 vs 0.824 on train, so the loss is mostly extent.
- March ongoing size check: predicted size is flat, 35% of queues gone by T+19 (train 28%); no bias to correct.

**New data source (27 Sep): on/off-ramp flows.** Neither task used them.
- They are released even inside the mainline blackouts (80% valid, the same as normal rows).
- Task 1 is offline, so it may use them at any time. Task 2 may use ramp values ≤ T only.

**Closed today:**
- **Eligibility-aware decoding** (`t2/elig.py`). Plain top-m is already optimal.
- **Importance-weighted onset training** (section 18). It lost beyond seed noise.
- **Diverse-hyperparameter member (H4).** Cancelled in favour of the ramp member. The knobs `TFB_LEAVES/FF/MINDATA/L2/EXTRA` remain available.

## Decision log
| Date | Submission | Public (Δ vs best) | Decision / lesson |
|---|---|---|---|
| 09-25 | F1: onset re-decoded with logit bias +0.5 (+15 cells, 12 in validation) | 0.86356 (−0.00235) | Larger onset sets hurt on March (onset −0.016); the official first-slot blocks are not larger than ours. Keep b = 0 |
| 09-25 | F2: onset site-commit decoder `site2_lo.05_r.5` (−11 hedge cells) | 0.86418 (−0.00173) | Fewer hedges hurt too (onset −0.012). Top-m at b = 0 is optimal on March from both sides; onset gains must come from better probabilities, not decoding |
| 09-25 | **G1: E1 + TV density smoothing inside target runs** (state rows only) | **0.86651 (+0.00060)** | Local J predicted +0.00062. **Adopted: new best.** The Task 3 proxy predicts the LB to within 0.00002 |
| 09-25 | **G2: G1 + onset v8** (stacking 0.3 + 9-seed mix; 15 cells, 11 in 4 validation windows) | **0.86711 (+0.00060)** | CV onset +0.0035 hybrid / +0.0024 old, i.e. about +0.0005 total. **Adopted: new best.** Shape-aware hedges from stage 2 help on March, where F1's blanket bias hurt |
| 09-27 | **H3: H2 + third Task 1 seed** (state rows only) | **0.86799 (+0.00022)** | local J +0.00023. **Adopted: new best.** The Task 1/3 proxy matches the LB on five changes in a row |
| 09-27 | G7: H3 with ongoing v7 (hybrid labels) | 0.86779 (−0.00020) | March ongoing −0.0013 against CV +0.0032 (hybrid) / +0.0006 (old). The official ongoing truth does not reward the hybrid edge cells. **Ongoing label work closed** |
| 09-27 | **H5w: ramp member, blackout-weighted** (state rows only) | **0.86838 (+0.00039)** | Local J +0.00081, so the LB gave half. **Adopted: new best.** Blackout-only gains need a haircut: 2 of 10 panels (D12_I405) have no test blackouts, and the holdout overstates the rest |
| 09-27 | H6: H5w with blackout rows = mean(full7, full8) | 0.86839 (+0.00001) | Local +0.00016. Rescoring without blackout cells: H5w's non-blackout part is only +0.00008, so its blackout part transferred about 50% and H6's about 5%. **Blackout ΔJ rests on 10 blackouts per panel and is noisy; discount it to ~1/3.** Pause blackout-model work |
| 09-26 | **H2: G2 + Task 1 seed ensemble** (state rows only) | **0.86777 (+0.00066)** | local J +0.00077. **Adopted: new best** |
| 09-26 | H1b: H2 + ongoing v10 (stage 2 may only remove cells, recurrence ≥ 0.05) | 0.86629 (−0.00148) | Passed the new Task 2 gate and still failed (ongoing −0.010). **Ongoing stacking line dropped, final pick included.** Ongoing changes are LB probes first from now on |
| 09-26 | P5 probe: H2 + TV smoothing ×3 | 0.86736 (−0.00041) | local −0.00062. The official Task 3 truth behaves like the train truth, and the smoothing strength is at or near its optimum |
| 09-26 | P6 probe: H2 with the queue zeroed | 0.63144 | S_queue(H2) 0.7878 exactly (onset 0.732, ongoing 0.843) |
| 09-25 | G3: G2 + ongoing v9 stage-2 stacking (217 ongoing cells, 139 in validation) | 0.86361 (−0.00350) | CV +0.0065 ± 0.0009 (7 SE) but **March ongoing −0.023**. Not adopted, and not on the robust list. The stack extends queues (D7_I10_E +22 to +27 cells per window) and reshuffles small ones (D7_I10_W, D12_I5_N). Train-month growth patterns don't hold in the shifted months. **Lesson: plain CV cannot gate Task 2 ongoing changes; build a shift-weighted CV first** |

## Robust list (final-selection pool)
Empty so far.

## Backlog (ordered by expected gain per effort)
1. **Shift-weighted CV for Task 2** (the gate for every future Task 2 change).
   - Importance weights make train CV windows resemble the validation or the private windows. They come from a classifier on window-level features known at T.
   - It must reproduce today's LB directions before it is trusted: F1 −, F2 −, G2 +, G3 −.
   - Use it for all Task 2 candidates, with a separate April (private) weighting for final selection.
2. Task 1/3 per-cell accuracy. Isolated target cells carry 46–48% of the LWR loss and short runs (2–3 cells) 36–38% (T3_SMOOTHING.md):
   - seed/bagging ensemble of the six Task 1 models (hold fit for the J gate, then a full fit);
   - flow-model capacity, since flow error dominates free-flow density error.
3. Robustness to incidents and non-recurrent queues (private has 7 incidents), for onset and ongoing:
   - incident-signature features: a sudden drop in downstream capacity, or a speed drop that time
     of day doesn't explain;
   - upweighting non-recurrent windows;
   - recent-month features for private built from March's masked view (all ≤ T).
4. Ongoing capacity: all candidate windows, bigger trees.
5. Task 1 transductive fine-tuning on observed cells of the validation/private months.
6. Ongoing label fix v7 as an LB test (low priority: its non-recurrent slice got worse).

Closed:
- Ongoing stage-2 stacking v9 (G3): failed transfer (−0.00350). Revisit only through the shift-weighted CV.
- Onset stacking and seeds: adopted in G2. Seed means saturate at 3; dropping on_v2 (v3x6) is exploratory only.
- Task 3 TV smoothing: adopted in G1 (+0.00060). Gate 0.7 adds only +0.00004 locally (noise); a = 1.0 fails the gate.
- decoder calibration (F1/F2 above);
- ongoing logit bias: CV optimum at b = 0 (0.8833). Only the official train windows prefer larger
  sets, which did not transfer for onset.

## Final selection (5–6 Nov)
- Recommend 2 finals: the best public score, and the most robust (best local validation and
  non-recurrent performance, from the robust list).
- The Kaggle CLI cannot select finals, so ask the user to tick them. If none are ticked, Kaggle
  takes the top 2 public.
- After the deadline, delete the Routines and send the final report.

## Backup (daily, evening sweep)
`python3 -m trafficflow.loop backup [EXTRA_GLOB ...]` creates a new version of the private Kaggle
dataset `kragglenote2forwork/tfb-work`, replacing the old one. The first version (2026-09-25) holds
18 files, 482 MB:
- the best zip;
- `work/t1/pred/state_full3.parquet` and `work/t1/models/full3/`;
- `work/t2/lgb_v6.csv`, `work/t2/probs_lgb_v5.parquet`, `work/t2h/probs_v6_onset.parquet` and
  `work/t2h/model_v6_*`;
- `work/t4/t4_l2proj.csv`;
- `research/lb/lb_with_era.csv`.

## Recovery (fresh container)
1. **Credentials.** If `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` is missing, use env `KAGGLE_USERNAME`/`KAGGLE_KEY`,
   or copy `/root/.claude/uploads/*/*kaggle.json` to `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (chmod 600). If there
   are none: report to the user and pause submissions.
2. **Data.** `kaggle competitions download -c 2026-ieee-big-data-traffic-flow-bench -p /home/user/data`,
   then unzip into `/home/user/data/kaggle_public` (README.md, config, corridors, task1, task2,
   task4, submission_key.csv, sample_submission.csv).
3. **Caches.** `python3 -m trafficflow.data` rebuilds `/home/user/cache/<panel>.npz`.
4. **Artefacts.** `kaggle datasets download kragglenote2forwork/tfb-work -p /home/user/work/restore --unzip`,
   then move each file back to its path in `manifest.json`. Kaggle unpacks the best zip into a
   folder, so re-zip that CSV with `loop pack` (copy the checks.json from git history or rebuild).
   Submissions can resume from here.
5. **Research state (hours, in the background):**
   - Task 2: `trafficflow/t2/run_all.sh`;
   - Task 1: `trafficflow/t1_pipeline.py` stages (`TFB_FD=1`).
