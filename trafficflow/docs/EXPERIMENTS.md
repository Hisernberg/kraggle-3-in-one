# Experiment log

All numbers are local. S_state uses the official formula on the train holdout (days 243–272). The LWR
proxy is `evaluate.s_lwr_proxy`. J = 0.35·S_state + 0.10·S_LWR is the part of S_total that Task 1
controls; S_FD is about constant.

## Task 1 / Task 3

| # | Setup | S_state | LWR proxy | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E0 | historical mean (official baseline), D7_I10_W | 0.832 | 0.070 | full train, no blackouts |
| E0 | temporal linear interpolation, D7_I10_W | 0.932 | 0.534 | |
| E1 | per-panel LightGBM residual on interpolation, 500k rows, D7_I10_W | 0.9507 | 0.585 | holdout, no blackouts |
| E2 | + L1 density model, q = v·k̂ | 0.9478 | 0.607 | J +0.0014 |
| E3 | blackout cells, D7_I10_W: interpolation vs gap-LGB | speed RMSE 5.81 → 5.36 | | regular cells about 1.1 |
| P1 | pooled 10-panel LightGBM (150k reg/panel), sampled holdout with dark share reweighted | **0.9385** family mean | | raw |
| P1 | same, reconcile a=0.25 | 0.9348 | | costs mostly dark-cell flow |
| P1-full | full-coverage holdout, realistic blackout density, 4 panels | raw → recon a=0.25 | LWR +0.013 to +0.081 | J +0.0010 to +0.0062 on every panel → **adopt a=0.25** |

Pooled model holdout RMSE:
- regular cells: speed 1.54, flow 30.6/lane, density (Huber) 0.567
- dark cells: speed 6.90, flow 65.9/lane, density 3.21

Error budget (regular cells):
- free flow: 97% of cells, 74% of speed SSE and 91% of flow SSE (noise floor)
- queued: 2% of cells, 22% of speed SSE

## Physics facts
- Congested observations lie on the congested branch of the released triangular FD: median deviation
  0.0%, IQR ±2.4%. In free flow, v ≈ v_f (std 2.5 including the transition zone).
- Observed |ΔN|/N per step is 4.4%. The topology-based flux correlates with ΔN at only 0.06, so the
  organizer's flux must absorb the noise, which is why the proxy is valid.

## Task 2 (agent report, trafficflow/docs/TASK2_ANALYSIS.md)
CV S_queue on 5,083 selector-replicated windows (official aggregation):

| Method | S_queue (sim) |
|---|---|
| persistence (official) | 0.285 |
| persistence_fill | 0.353 |
| rules | 0.663 |
| lgb_v2 | 0.788 |
| **lgb_v3** | **0.795** (onset 0.713, ongoing 0.877) |

## Task 4 (agent report, trafficflow/docs/TASK4_ANALYSIS.md)
The L2 projection of the split prior onto the split counts reproduces the published baseline S_ODME
(0.8357 vs 0.8359). Expected S_ODME is about 1.000.

## Expected S_total (local estimates)
| Task | Estimate | Weighted |
|---|---|---|
| state | ~0.935 | 0.327 |
| queue | ~0.75–0.79 | 0.225–0.237 |
| physics | ~(0.98 + 2·0.56)/3 ≈ 0.70 | 0.105 |
| ODME | ~1.0 | 0.200 |
| **total** | | **≈ 0.857–0.869** |

That compares with the best post-rebuild public score of 0.879. Our previous best was 0.80855.

### Decomposition of A (0.85204), exact from the probes
| Task | Weighted | Task score | Local estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| ODME | 0.19876 | 0.994 | 1.000 |
| queue | 0.22457 | 0.749 (onset 0.686, ongoing 0.812) | 0.795 (0.713 / 0.877) |
| state + physics | 0.42871 | S_state ≈ 0.935–0.94, S_phys ≈ 0.67–0.68 | 0.432 |

Where the headroom is:
- queue: +0.1 S_queue is worth +0.030 total. Ongoing robustness to incidents comes first.
- physics: +0.1 S_phys is worth +0.015. The density model and blackout cells are the levers.
- state: about +0.005 at most.
- ODME: done.

## Gated density reconciliation (2026-09-23)
Per speed band, the L1 density error (D12_I5_S holdout) shows where the density model is better:

| v/v_f | q/v | density model | FD(v) |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 0.4 | 2.99 | **1.50** | 1.77 |
| 0.4–0.6 | 3.40 | 2.82 | **2.64** |
| 0.6–0.8 | **4.83** | 5.10 | 5.50 |
| 0.8–0.9 | **2.85** | 3.73 | 5.94 |

The density model wins only in dense traffic, so reconciliation is gated to predicted v < 0.6·v_f.
Full-coverage holdout, realistic blackouts:

| Panel | J recon-all (A) | J gate 0.6 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| D12_I5_S | 0.38307 | 0.38529 | +0.0022 |
| D7_I10_W | 0.38704 | 0.38767 | +0.0006 |
| D7_I405_S | 0.37741 | 0.37928 | +0.0019 |
| D12_I405_N | 0.39010 | 0.39184 | +0.0017 |

Gating improves J on 4/4 panels (mean +0.0016 total) and is adopted: `make_submission --gate 0.6`.
Adding FD density in 0.4–0.6·v_f changes J by −0.0002 to +0.0005, which is noise, so it is not adopted.

## Task 1/3 v2 round (2026-09-23 evening)
Full-coverage holdout, realistic blackouts, gate 0.6. J = 0.35·S_state + 0.10·S_LWR (the Task 1+3 part of S_total).

| Panel | hold1 (submitted) | hold2 (all new) | + longer blackout speed/flow only | + L1-leaning density only |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D12_I5_S | **0.38529** | 0.38422 | 0.38530 | 0.38419 |
| D7_I10_W | **0.38767** | 0.38747 | 0.38753 | 0.38760 |
| D7_I405_S | 0.37928 | 0.37900 | **0.37938** | 0.37890 |
| D12_I405_N | 0.39184 | 0.39157 | **0.39195** | 0.39144 |

- The L1-leaning density model (Huber α 0.2, 127 leaves) is worse on 4/4 panels, so it is **rejected**. The near-L2 density (α 1) is better for S_LWR.
- Longer-trained blackout models: mean +0.00002 total, which is noise and not worth a retrain.

**Speed/flow split inside the density gate.** LWR is unchanged, since q/v = k̂ for any a:

| Panel | a = 0.25 (A, B1) | a = 0.75 | a = 1.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| D12_I5_S | 0.93180 | **0.93429** | 0.93429 |
| D7_I10_W | 0.93996 | 0.94091 | **0.94109** |
| D7_I405_S | 0.91588 | **0.91845** | 0.91819 |
| D12_I405_N | 0.94800 | **0.94934** | 0.94930 |

a = 0.75 improves S_state on 4/4 panels (mean +0.0018, about +0.0006 total). In queues, flow sits near discharge capacity while speed carries the uncertainty. **Adopted** (`--recon-a 0.75 --gate 0.6`).

## Task 2 v5 (2026-09-23 evening, agent)
CV on sim / official windows. Details in trafficflow/docs/TASK2_ANALYSIS.md section 12.

| Slice | v4 (in B1) | v5 |
|---|---|---|
| overall | 0.7971 / 0.8233 | **0.8022 / 0.8299** |
| onset | 0.7133 | **0.7210** |
| ongoing | 0.8809 | **0.8833** |
| non-recurrent onset / ongoing (recur < 0.05) | 0.275 / 0.588 | **0.295 / 0.599** |

## Candidates for 2026-09-24 (single-factor chain, each passes 65/65 checks)
| File | Differs from | Change | Expected Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C1_gate06_t2v5.zip` | B1 | Task 2 v4 → v5 (279 queue cells) | about +0.0015 (CV × 0.30), possibly more on March |
| `C2_gate06a75_t2v5.zip` | C1 | gate split a 0.25 → 0.75 (266,914 dense-traffic state cells) | about +0.0006 |

## Task 1 with FD (fundamental-diagram) features, hold3 (2026-09-24)
Column-based FD features (`TFB_FD=1`, `t1_pipeline.add_fd`, verified identical to the native path): congested-branch flow implied by speed, speed implied by flow, and q/v density for the interpolated/previous/next values, plus `fd_w`, `fd_kj` and v/v_f.

Holdout RMSE, hold1 → hold3:

| Model | hold1 | hold3 |
|---|---|---|
| speed | 1.543 | 1.515 |
| flow | 30.57 | 30.19 |
| density | 0.567 | 0.541 |
| dark speed | 6.903 | 6.888 |
| dark flow | 65.86 | 65.70 |
| dark density | 3.21 | 3.19 |

Full-coverage holdout, gate 0.6, a = 0.75:

| Panel | J hold1 | J hold3 | Δ | LWR hold1 → hold3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D12_I5_S | 0.38618 | 0.38810 | +0.0019 | 0.5916 → 0.6068 |
| D7_I10_W | 0.38800 | 0.38862 | +0.0006 | 0.5868 → 0.5905 |
| D7_I405_S | 0.38044 | 0.38215 | +0.0017 | 0.5896 → 0.5985 |
| D12_I405_N | 0.39232 | 0.39293 | +0.0006 | 0.6005 → 0.6055 |

Better on 4/4 panels (mean +0.0012 total), with gains from both the speed/flow and the density models. **Adopted.** Full-data fit `full3` is in progress.

## Day summary 2026-09-24: B1 0.85732 → E1 0.86591 (+0.0086)
Every step changed a single, locally validated factor. Each Task 1 delta matched its holdout prediction to within 0.0002.

| Step | Change | LB Δ | Local prediction |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | queue v5 (physics + shockwave features) | +0.00243 (ΔS_queue +0.0081) | CV +0.005 × 0.30 |
| S2 | onset v6 (trained on corrected labels) | +0.00453 (onset +0.030) | CV onset +0.005 to +0.012 |
| S3 | gate split a = 0.75 | +0.00064 | +0.0006 |
| S4 | Task 1 FD-feature models | +0.00099 | +0.0012 |

**Decomposition of E1 (0.86591).** Only the gating share of B1 is estimated locally; everything else is exact from probes and single-factor deltas.

| Task | Weighted | Task score |
|---|---|---|
| ODME | 0.19876 | 0.994 |
| Task 1 + 3 | ≈ 0.4319 | 0.4287 (A) + gating 0.0016 + split 0.0006 + FD 0.0010 |
| queue | ≈ 0.2352 | S_queue ≈ 0.784: **onset 0.728 (exact)**, ongoing ≈ 0.840 |

The ongoing retrain on corrected labels (v7) was rejected: +0.0006 in the conservative evaluation, and the non-recurrent slice got worse. The label bias sits at queue formation, not inside established queues.

**Next lever: onset.**
- March onset is 0.728, against about 0.76 in CV (old truth) and about 0.86 (corrected truth), so March onsets transfer worst. Diagnose March onset windows next (site recurrence, time of day, incident-like sites) with history-only features.
- Each +0.1 onset is worth +0.015 total. The gap to the leader is 0.0173.

## Decoding calibration (2026-09-25)
**Onset, v6 hybrid OOF on re-drawn windows** (`python -m trafficflow.t2.calib cv` / `decoders`, T2_WORK=t2h):

| logit bias b | hybrid sim | hybrid off | old sim | old off | rec<0.05 | rec<0.2 | cells/window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| −0.5 | 0.8563 | 0.8841 | 0.7844 | 0.7943 | 0.394 | 0.691 | 3.92 |
| **0 (v6)** | **0.8589** | 0.8841 | **0.7871** | 0.7943 | 0.412 | 0.704 | 4.00 |
| +0.25 | 0.8594 | 0.8841 | 0.7869 | 0.7943 | 0.418 | 0.707 | 4.04 |
| +0.5 | 0.8588 | 0.8928 | 0.7862 | 0.8038 | 0.419 | 0.707 | 4.07 |
| +1.0 | 0.8554 | 0.8970 | 0.7824 | 0.8088 | 0.434 | 0.713 | 4.16 |

- Site-commit decoders cost −0.001 to −0.002. `site2_lo.05_r.5` is −0.0010 ± 0.0012 hybrid and −0.0009 ± 0.0011 old (paired, 94 windows changed: 44 better, 50 worse).
- The contiguous-range and anchor decoders lose heavily (0.795 and 0.562 hybrid).

**On the LB, both directions lose on March:**
- b = +0.5 adds hedge cells: onset −0.016.
- `site2` removes them: onset −0.012.
- **Conclusion:** the v6 top-m decoder at b = 0 is at the March optimum. Onset gains have to come from better probabilities.
- The added cells were mostly extra sites in uncertain windows (D12_I5_N, D12_I5_S, D7_I405_S). Removing the model's own hedges also hurts, so the hedges it picks do hit.

**Ongoing, v5 blend OOF, original windows, old truth** (`calib cv_ongoing`):

| b | −0.5 | −0.25 | **0** | +0.25 | +0.5 | +1.0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sim | 0.8797 | 0.8827 | **0.8833** | 0.8820 | 0.8788 | 0.8659 |
| off | 0.8790 | 0.8866 | 0.8906 | 0.8950 | 0.8960 | 0.8889 |

- The official train windows prefer larger sets for both conditions. That preference did not transfer to the LB for onset, so it is an artefact of our truth on those windows (5-minute selector shifts), not a property of the official truth.
- No ongoing bias probe was spent.

## Task 3: TV density smoothing (2026-09-25, agent; details in trafficflow/docs/T3_SMOOTHING.md)
**The method:**
- Total-variation smoothing of the per-lane density k = q/v inside each run of consecutive target cells on a link. Small increments inside a run are set to zero; queue fronts are kept.
- The threshold is τ × the run's mean density: free-flow 0.0075, gate (v < 0.6·v_f) 0.02, blackout 0.05. Weak L1 anchors tie the run ends to the observed neighbours.
- Outside the gate only the flow moves; inside it, the a = 0.75 split applies.

**Holdout J with hold3, gate 0.6, a 0.75:**

| | D12_I5_S | D7_I10_W | D7_I405_S | D12_I405_N | mean ΔJ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline J | 0.38810 | 0.38862 | 0.38215 | 0.39293 | |
| TV J | 0.38877 | 0.38930 | 0.38262 | 0.39358 | **+0.00062 (4/4)** |
| LWR baseline → TV | 0.6068 → 0.6132 | 0.5905 → 0.5967 | 0.5985 → 0.6032 | 0.6055 → 0.6116 | +0.0058 |

- Parameters were chosen on 2 panels and confirmed on the other 2.
- Quadratic smoothing gives +0.00018. Moving speed instead of flow gives +0.00021. Density blends are negative.
- Gate 0.7 adds +0.00004 (noise); a = 1.0 fails.

**Where the LWR loss sits (baseline):**
- isolated target cells 46–48%;
- runs of 2–3 cells 36–38%;
- runs of 4+ cells 9–10%;
- blackout runs 5–9%.

Only the within-run transitions (about 29% of the loss) can be smoothed. **LB: G1 +0.00060 against the local +0.00062.**

## Day summary 2026-09-25: E1 0.86591 → G2 0.86711 (+0.0012), rank 9 of 140 post-rebuild
| Step | Change | LB Δ | Local prediction | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | onset logit bias +0.5 | −0.00235 | CV flat, off-windows + | decoder at its optimum |
| F2 | onset site-commit decoder | −0.00173 | CV −0.0010 ± 0.0012 | decoder at its optimum |
| G1 | Task 3 TV density smoothing | +0.00060 | +0.00062 | adopted |
| G2 | onset v8 stacking + seeds | +0.00060 | about +0.0005 | adopted |
| G3 | ongoing v9 stage-2 stacking | −0.00350 | +0.0010 (CV mix) to +0.0018 (reweighted) | failed transfer |

- **Tasks 1/3.** The local proxy stays exact to within 0.0002.
- **Task 2 onset.** Transfers roughly as predicted.
- **Task 2 ongoing.** Gains that exist only on train months don't transfer. On March the stack extended growing queues on D7_I10_E and reshuffled small queues.
- **Next step.** Make the Task 2 gate shift-aware: importance-weighted CV toward the validation and private window distributions, checked against today's four LB outcomes before it is trusted.

## 2026-09-26 chain: G2 0.86711 → H2 0.86777
**Exact decomposition of H2 (0.86777), from P6 and P1:**

| Task | Weighted | Task score |
|---|---|---|
| ODME | 0.19876 | 0.994 |
| Task 1+3 | 0.43268 | S_state ≈ 0.94, S_phys ≈ 0.69 (S_LWR ≈ 0.55) |
| queue | 0.23633 | S_queue 0.7878: onset 0.732 (P4 + G2 Δ), ongoing 0.843 |

**Lessons**
- **Task 1/3.** Local J keeps predicting the LB to within 0.0002: H2 +0.00066 vs +0.00077; P5 −0.00041 vs −0.00062.
- **Ongoing.** Stage-2 re-scoring hurts March even when it may only remove cells (H1b −0.010) or passes the shift-weighted CV and footprint checks. The March ongoing level (0.843) matches the validation-weighted CV (0.849), but no train-based evaluation predicts the *direction* of ongoing edits. From now on, ongoing changes are LB probes first.
- **Leaderboard.** KTK 0.90033 (+0.012 on 25 Sep), gichang 0.89173, Inocchi 0.88635. We are 10th of 151 post-rebuild, gap 0.0326.
  - Where a 0.033 gap could come from: +0.1 S_queue = +0.030; +0.1 S_LWR = +0.010 (ceiling 0.955 against our ~0.55).

## Leaderboard 2026-09-27 00:10 UTC
We are 14th of 170 post-rebuild (20th overall) with H2 = 0.86777. The top post-rebuild teams are KTK 0.90038, gichang 0.89628, Inocchi 0.88635,
Giorgio Ottoboni 0.88458 and Lukas 0.88382 (gap 0.0326). No new candidates were ready on 26 Sep, and the 26 Sep evening sweep ran in plan mode, so nothing ran.
