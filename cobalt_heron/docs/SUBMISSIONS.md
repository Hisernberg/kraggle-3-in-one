Takeaways from day 1:
- The LB shows only 2 decimals.
- OOF and the LB move in the same direction: the filter helps, and too strict a filter hurts.
- LB ≈ 0.84 × OOF@2048.
- To move the LB we need larger OOF gains (≥ +0.02): more OOF folds for tuning, longer training, bigger encoders.

Account history before cobalt-heron: 0.55 came from the public hdjojo/lamhuy payload (see ANALYSIS.md), and there was an unknown 0.33.

Day 2:
- Training longer (3000 vs 1100 steps) gives +0.01 on the LB.
- Averaging with the weaker short-trained models hurts.
- Next: long-trained models only (r34 2500, r18 folds at 3000+ steps).
- Local long runs die when the container restarts while idle, so all training now runs on Kaggle CPU kernels.
- Day-2 end: plateau at 0.35. The r34 encoder alone is not better than r18 (0.34), and the r34+r18 ensemble ties at 0.35. On OOF, FN dominates (TP 3091 / FP 1418 / FN 2531 at thr 0.40).
- Next levers: 4500-step r18 (ch-unet-r18-full-s5, running), a 2048 crop refiner for SQ, YOLO11-seg on GPU after the Saturday quota reset, and fusing U-Net and YOLO instances.
- 2026-09-26: +0.02 LB from longer training (4000–4500 steps), a filter retrained on 5-fold / 586-image OOF with richer features, and a stricter 2048 upsample threshold. GPU quota is back: YOLO11m-seg kernels ch-yolo-f0 (fold-0 OOF for tuning) and ch-yolo-full are training.
